**The Offline-First, AI-Augmented Trading Journal for Power Users.**

## Core Principles

*   **🛡️ Offline-First & Private**: Your data stays on your machine. All trades, journals, and statistics are stored locally in a high-performance SQLite database. No cloud accounts, no subscription fees, no data mining.
*   **⚡ Low-Friction Entry**: Log trades in seconds. Smart parsing, auto-completion, and quick-entry templates remove the friction from journaling, so you can focus on the market.
*   **🤖 Optional AI Augmentation**: Leverage Google Gemini AI for deep insights, pattern recognition, and "tough love" feedback—but only when *you* choose. AI features are opt-in and use your own API key.
*   **📊 Power-User Analytics**: Go beyond simple P&L. Track MFE/MAE, R-multiples, heatmaps, and psychological tags. Visualize your edge with professional-grade charts and equity curves.
*   **🗣️ Voice-to-Text Integration**: Dictate your trade thoughts in real-time. Built-in local STT (Whisper via Transformers.js) or cloud-based transcription ensures you capture your mindset without typing.
*   **✏️ Built-in Chart Markup**: Draw directly on your uploaded charts within the app. Add trendlines, support/resistance boxes, circles, and text annotations to highlight your edge without external tools.
